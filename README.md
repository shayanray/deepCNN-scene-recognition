# Task

Using deep learning tools for computer vision. Design and train deep convolutional networks for scene recognition using PyTorch.

Experiments:

Training a Network From Scratch

Fine Tuning a Pre-Trained Deep Network

Bag of SIFT Representation + one-vs-all SVMs


## Results
Test Accuracy of the model with Network from Scratch on the 10000 test images: 60.0000 %
Test Accuracy of the model with Pre-Trained Deep Network on the 10000 test images: 85.0000 %


## Implementation
Leveraging pytorch utils the networks were designed and implemented to accomplish the task.
